# Similar Products

In order to understand the feasibility of our product, we searched for similar products on the web. 

We found several simple mesh network simulators on GitHub that simulate simple communication between a small set of nodes. Example: 

- [Mesh Network Simulation](https://github.com/mnutsch/Mesh_Network_Simulation) : A simulation of a mobile ad hoc network with some stationary nodes written in JavaScript and HTML5. 

Even though the end goal is the same, projects like this one lack most features that our product will have. They are very generalized, as such, they do not apply to context as our product. Hence, it is safe to conclude that projects like this one do not represent competition to our product.
