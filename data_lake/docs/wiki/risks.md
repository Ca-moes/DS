# Risks
## Main risks that may impede success

Even the most carefully and meticulously planned software project can run into trouble. No matter how well you plan, a project can always encounter unexpected problems.

Thus, it is up to the team members to identify the potential risks, analyse how likely they are to occur, take action to prevent the risks, or to minimize the ones you can't avoid.

A risk is any uncertain event or condition that might affect your project, and there are four basic ways to handle risks: to avoid, mitigate, transfer or accept them. 

Here are some of the risks our team believes might eventually end up occuring:

- **Existence of simultaneous work from other classes:** This is a risk that cannot be avoided. Fortunately, it is a risk every member of our team is used to dealing with, by being able to properly manage our time.

- **Not being acquainted with some of the used tools:** As the previous risk, this is a very much solvable risk, that our team has already encountered in the past. To mitigate this risk, we will commit to learn to use all the tools that we're not so confortable with.

- **Some missing data that may turn out to be different:** As we started to work on our project vertical, we had to and will have to make some assumptions on the data that is going to be given to us by the warehouse. It obviously may turn out to be different than what we envision.

- **Difficulty when joining the different verticals of the project:** The final risk our team has considered up to this point, is the possibiliy of running into some problems when merging our work with the other teams. The possibility of having to make a lot of changes before merging is certainly not pleasant, so we will try our best to prevent the situation by comunicating and exchanging information with our class colleagues beforehand.
