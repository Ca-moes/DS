# Similar Projects Survey / Market Research
## Introduction

To be better prepared for what awaits us in this project, we did some market research for projects where there is data collection from a network of sensors and/or other sources:

## [Collecting and Disseminating Smart Home Sensor Data](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aaron-Crandall/publication/228639439_Collecting_and_disseminating_smart_home_sensor_data_in_the_CASAS_project/links/0fcfd5080762fcc915000000/Collecting-and-disseminating-smart-home-sensor-data-in-the-CASAS-project.pdf)

Very much like our project, this project (CASAS) collects information given by sensors placed all over a house. 

With the gathered information, it is possible to determine when a person does an erroneous activity such as leaving the water running after washing their hands.

## [Experfy](https://www.experfy.com)

An on-demand consulting and training marketplace, Harvard innovation lab Experfy facilitates the creation of smart cities using sensor networks that collect and transmit data about resource usage. 

As a result, less energy is wasted, more water is conserved, traffic is reduced, etc.

## [UPS](https://www.ups.com/us/en/Home.page)

UPS has equipped all of its delivery fleet with sensors that record numerous data points. 

For example, it results in the capability of altering the routes in real-time, depending on the data received from weather condition sensors, among many other benefits.

## Conclusion

Although we did find plenty of interesting information and complex projects on data collection with a network of sensors, we weren't able to find a project that used that knowledge and applied it in the optimization of the performance of a warehouse.

Thus, we are able to take existing experiences and important information to then try to apply them in a different situation, our Warehouse of the Future.
